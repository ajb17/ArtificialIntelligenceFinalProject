The main Genetic Algorithm code exists in the neuralNetGA.py file

snake8x8Simulator is what is used to test a neural network, and requires
a feature extractor from the Genetic_Algorithms/Feature_Extractors files.

The fitness function used for the report is defined in the main file as snake8x8Eval,
ignore the FitnessFunctions directory and the FitnessFunctions.py file

several example of models and run configurations are in the main file in comments
